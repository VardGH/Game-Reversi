Game Play

Othello is a strategy board game played between 2 players. One player plays black and the other white.
Each player gets 32 discs and black always starts the game.
Then the game alternates between white and black until:
	1.one player can not make a valid move to outflank the opponent.
	2.both players have no valid moves.

When a player has no valid moves, he pass his turn and the opponent continues.
A player can not voluntarily forfeit his turn.
When both players can not make a valid move the gane ends.

Valid Moves

Black always moves first.
A move is made by placing a disc of the player's color on the board in a position that "out-flanks" one or more of the opponent's discs.
A disc or row of discs is outflanked when it is surrounded at the ends by discs of the opposite color.
A disc may outflank any number of discs in one or more rows in any direction (horizontal, vertical, diagonal).

End of the Game

When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over.
The discs are now counted and the player with the majority of his or her color discs on the board is the winner.
A tie is possible.

Time Limit

Players can start with a preset time limit for their total number of moves. This timing element adds more pressure to the game.
The clock will start counting down at the beginning of a player's first move and be paused each time they complete a turn whilst the opposing player's clock is ticking down.
There are varying time limits ranging from 5 minutes up to 30 minutes as seen in the world championship rules.
When one player's clock runs out of time, no matter what the position or number of chips on the board, that player looses the game.
